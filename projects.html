          Brief description: A gaming application for virtual reality glasses
          and the Futurift V2. The game is based on the Harry Potter universe.
          During the session, the player, being in the Futurift simulator and
          the Oculus Rift CV1, controls the broom with the left controller,
          moving its position, and the right controller interacts with the
          quofle (game ball). The player's task is to score as many balls into
          the ring as possible in the allotted time.<br />
          The Futurift chair simulates broom tilting, thereby enhancing the
          player's immersion in virtual reality.

          Brief description: Interactive map for the stand of Primorye at EEF
          2019. With it’s help visitors could study the future changes of the
          Russky Island. There are several types of objects that have only 1
          approximation and which are shown in white volumes with filled
          boarder, and more elaborate objects for which there are visualizations
          and detailed information. When you click on any object — general
          information appears on the screen. For the most important objects
          there is an opportunity to "show more." This screen displays slides
          and accompanying text. We also showed objects already existing on the
          island, for some there is a second step of approximation. Large things
          are shown at the entire map scale. The project was implemented in two
          weeks. In the second week all the graphics materials appeared, to
          create which we used a model designed for the video.
