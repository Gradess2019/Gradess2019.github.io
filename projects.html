          for virtual reality glasses and the Futurift V2. The game is based on
          the Harry Potter universe. During the session, the player, being in
          the Futurift simulator and the Oculus Rift CV1, controls the broom
          with the left controller, moving its position, and the right
          controller interacts with the quofle (game ball). The player's task is
          to score as many balls into the ring as possible in the allotted
          time.<br />
          The Futurift chair simulates broom tilting, thereby enhancing the
          player's immersion in virtual reality.

          stand of Primorye at EEF 2019. With it’s help visitors could study the
          future changes of the Russky Island. There are several types of
          objects that have only 1 approximation and which are shown in white
          volumes with filled boarder, and more elaborate objects for which
          there are visualizations and detailed information. When you click on
          any object — general information appears on the screen. For the most
          important objects there is an opportunity to "show more." This screen
          displays slides and accompanying text. We also showed objects already
          existing on the island, for some there is a second step of
          approximation. Large things are shown at the entire map scale. The
          project was implemented in two weeks. In the second week all the
          graphics materials appeared, to create which we used a model designed
          for the video.
